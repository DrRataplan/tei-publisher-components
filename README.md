# Web Components for TEI Publisher

This repository contains web components used by TEI Publisher and apps generated by it. Distributing the components in a separate package has several benefits:

* generated apps can depend on a specific version of the components without getting into conflict with other apps
* the components can be embedded into any environment, e.g. a CMS or blog software, as long as they can communicate with a TEI Publisher instance running somewhere else

## Quick Start

Clone the repository, call `npm install` once and run `npm start`. This creates a simple webserver which you can access in a browser to see the documentation and demos.

## Building

Run `npm run build:production` to generate a single `bundle.js` containing all components and their dependencies.
